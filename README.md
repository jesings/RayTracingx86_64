## Computer Graphics Final Project

What I did:

Ray Tracing --> triangle ray intersection

Added semi-functional shadow rays

Sphere intersection

Notes:

Shadows don't block ambient light, and don't render very well, they are turned off in the test image

The camera is NOT treated to be at infinity, and thus there is a slight fish-eye effect because the camera can view things from a specific perspective, thus if you made the same set of 2 images with a slightly displaced camera, you could potentially make an image that you could view in 3d using a VR headset--just a cool thought I had.

The reflections can make certain whole triangles change color
