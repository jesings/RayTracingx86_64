## Computer Graphics Final Project

Initial goal:

Ray Tracing --> Starting out super basic, just triangle plane intersection, using Phong reflection to handle different kinds of light, potentially switching over to Blinn-Phong, the base version will be significantly optimized, as is borderline-necessary for applications like these.

Stretch goals:

Refracted ray handling--> This one I'm likely to do byt I'm not sure how difficult base ray tracing will be without refracted rays, so I'm tentatively putting this in the stretch goal section

Other shape intersections (i.e. sphere/torus intersections for ray tracing to eliminate the need to break them down into triangles)

Multiple light sources

Mesh file parser

Texture mapping

Other stuff?
