## Computer Graphics Final Project

Initial goal:

Ray Tracing --> Starting out super basic, just triangle plane intersection, using Phong reflection to handle different kinds of light, potentially switching over to Blinn-Phong, the base version will be significantly optimized, as is borderline-necessary for applications like these.

Added shadow rays

Semi-functional sphere intersection
